                    <p>
                        A skyline is the outline or shape viewed near the horizon. It can be created by a city's overall structure, or by human intervention in a rural setting, or in nature that is formed where the sky meets buildings or the land. 
                        City skylines serve as a pseudo-fingerprint as no two skylines are alike.
